			<p>11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.</p>
			<p>12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</p>
			<p>13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</p>
